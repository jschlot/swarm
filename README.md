# swarm - a game of choices

## Synopsis

Swarm works by presenting a player with a story that contains an episode list. Each episode has many "choose your own" style chapter objects. Each choice sets alignment scores and sends you to another location in the chapter.

As the player progresses through the story, they are cast into their overall player alignment. Additional gameplay is then dictated based on alterations based on this player alignment.

## Installation

Once cloned, you should do standard npm stuff. `npm install` is your first step. Then `npm start` to begin the app,
listening on localhost:3000 (this is using the webpack developer server).
