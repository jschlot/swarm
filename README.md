# swarm - a game of choices

## Synopsis

The idea started as a quiz, like many on Buzzfeed. I wanted to make a system that could take a set of weighted choices, 
and then reduce these choices down to a single result. A user might come in, choose some answers to a set of questions,
and I should be able to tell them which character from Star Wars they are like.

## Installation

Once cloned, you should do standard npm stuff. `npm install` is your first step. Then `npm start` to begin the app,
listening on localhost:3000 (this is using the webpack developer server).
